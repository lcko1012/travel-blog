# Travel Blog Frontend

A project of my subject. A site where people can share travel articles.
</br>
Link: http://langthang.tech/


## Travel Blog API
https://github.com/trinhdvt/lang-thang

## Description
On this site, people can share their articles, comment on articles, bookmark articles, and follow other users,... You can also be notified of the activities of the person you are following. 
</br>
To know more about this website, you can visit the link above

## Installation

### `npm install`

## Running the app
To be able to run this program you must have an api from the backend. So you can access the link of "Travel blog API" above and install it. 
</br>
After that, you can run the app.

### `npm start`

## Next Tasks
- Use Editor.js to create a new text editor instead of Draft.js
- PWA

I finally finished my project. But this site is still under development with my interesting ideas. 😙
