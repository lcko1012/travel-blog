# Travel Blog Frontend

A project of my subject. A site where people can share travel articles.
Link: http://langthang.eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com/


## Travel Blog API
https://github.com/trinhdvt/lang-thang

## Description
On this site, people can share their articles, comment on articles, save articles, and follow other users. You can also be notified of the activities of the person you are following.

## Installation


### `npm install`

## Running the app
### `npm start`

## How to test
The site is deployed with azure so I can't maintain it for long because my account is not responsive enough for this service. So you can contact me to test run this site. ðŸ˜ž
